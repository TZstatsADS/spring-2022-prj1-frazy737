### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: EDA project on interactions between various Philosophy schools
+ This project is conducted by Weixun Qian.

+ Project summary: When studying philosophy, an unavoidable problem would be comparing ideas among different philosophy schools and investigating their mutual interactions. A comprehensive and comparative study on several schools will enhance our understanding of philosophical ideas. In this project, we will dive into a text dataset containing 13 schools and 36 authors, and apply statistical analysis to find their mutual attitude and connection in ideas.
